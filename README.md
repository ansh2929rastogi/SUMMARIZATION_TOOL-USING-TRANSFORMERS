# SUMMARIZATION_TOOL-USING-TRANSFORMERS
Chat Summarization and Question–Answer Generation using Fine-Tuned LLM


🧠 Overview

This project implements a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) that automatically:

Generates concise summaries from two-person chat conversations

Produces a relevant set of question–answer pairs from the generated summary

The system is designed to reduce manual review time, improve information extraction, and enable automated knowledge creation from conversational data.

🚀 Features
